### Lecture 1: An Introduction to Intelligent Agents {#lecture-1}

This lecture explores the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its manifestations in machine intelligence. It encompasses various techniques enabling machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously. Different types of intelligent agents are discussed along with their characteristics, including reactivity, proactiveness, socialability, adaptability, and rationality.

### Lecture 2: Data Analysis and Visualization {#lecture-2}
This lecture focuses on data collection and preprocessing, crucial steps in preparing data for analysis or machine learning. It discusses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as understanding data, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, formulating hypotheses, guiding decision-making, and communicating insights.

---

### Lecture 3: Probability & Statistics {#lecture-3}

Probability and statistics are explored in this lecture, emphasizing concepts like random variables, probability distributions, and their applications. Examples include coin tosses, binomial distributions, and normal distributions, providing a foundation for understanding uncertainty and variability in data.

---

### Lecture 4: Linear Regression {#lecture-4}

Linear regression, a statistical method for modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables, is discussed. Both simple and multiple linear regression are covered, illustrating how to predict outcomes based on one or more predictors.



---

### Lecture 5: Logistic Regression {#lecture-5}
This lecture introduces logistic regression, a statistical technique used for predicting categorical outcomes based on predictor variables. Steps involved in developing a logistic regression model, including feature selection, model fitting, and interpretation of coefficients, are outlined.
