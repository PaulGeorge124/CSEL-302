### Lecture 1: An Introduction to Intelligent Agents {#lecture-1}

This lecture explores the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its manifestations in machine intelligence, encompassing various techniques enabling machines to perceive, learn, reason, solve problems, and act autonomously. Different types of intelligent agents are discussed, along with their characteristics, including reactivity, proactiveness, socialability, adaptability, and rationality. Additionally, the lecture delves into the ethical considerations surrounding AI development and deployment, addressing concerns such as bias, privacy, and accountability. Case studies highlighting the real-world applications of AI across diverse fields like healthcare, finance, and transportation are also examined, showcasing its transformative potential. Through engaging discussions and interactive demonstrations, participants gain a comprehensive understanding of AI's impact on society and the evolving landscape of intelligent technology.

### Lecture 2: Data Analysis and Visualization {#lecture-2}

This lecture focuses on data collection and preprocessing, crucial steps in preparing data for analysis or machine learning. It discusses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques such as understanding data, identifying patterns, detecting anomalies, formulating hypotheses, guiding decision-making, and communicating insights. Additionally, it explores best practices for data cleaning, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers to ensure the quality and reliability of the data used for analysis or modeling. Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, participants gain proficiency in leveraging EDA methods to extract meaningful insights and make informed decisions based on data.

### Lecture 3: Probability & Statistics {#lecture-3}

Probability and statistics are explored in this lecture, emphasizing concepts like random variables, probability distributions, and their applications. Examples include coin tosses, binomial distributions, and normal distributions, providing a foundation for understanding uncertainty and variability in data. Additionally, the lecture covers key statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation, along with hypothesis testing and statistical inference techniques to make data-driven decisions and draw conclusions from sample data. Through interactive exercises and real-world examples, participants gain a deeper understanding of how probability and statistics are essential tools for analyzing data and making informed decisions in various fields.

### Lecture 4: Linear Regression {#lecture-4}


Linear regression, a statistical method for modeling relationships between dependent and independent variables, is discussed in this lecture. Both simple and multiple linear regression are covered, illustrating how to predict outcomes based on one or more predictors. The lecture delves into the underlying principles of regression analysis, including the interpretation of coefficients, assessment of model fit, and evaluation of assumptions. Through practical examples and hands-on exercises, participants learn how to apply linear regression techniques to analyze data, make predictions, and uncover insights into the relationships between variables.

### Lecture 5: Logistic Regression {#lecture-5}
This lecture introduces logistic regression, a statistical technique used for predicting categorical outcomes based on predictor variables. Steps involved in developing a logistic regression model, including feature selection, model fitting, and interpretation of coefficients, are outlined. Additionally, the lecture covers concepts such as odds ratios, log-odds, and the logistic function, providing participants with a comprehensive understanding of how logistic regression can be applied to analyze and interpret data with categorical outcomes. Through practical examples and demonstrations, attendees gain proficiency in utilizing logistic regression as a powerful tool for classification and predictive modeling in various fields.
